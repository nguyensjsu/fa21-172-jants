# Starbucks Project

## Jay Solanki's Individual Status Report for Week 3

### My Accomplishments

* Created 3 new HTML pages for Rewards. These pages are called rewards.html, reward_redeemed.html, and enter_rewards.html.
* Added functionality to these HTML pages using thymeleaf and by writing Java code.
* Created the springreward folder and added the Java code to it. The Java files created include Reward.java, RewardController.java, and RewardRepository.java.
* This Java code added the following functionalities to Rewards:
    * It created a Rewards table in the database with five fields.
    * When the users are prompted to enter the Starbucks Stars they want to redeem, the data in this table is modified.
    * Selected modified data is then displayed to user using thymeleaf.

### Challenges

* Need to figure out a way to add rewards (Functionality added by Surya).
* Need to work on the problems in reset password functionality (Fixed by me).
