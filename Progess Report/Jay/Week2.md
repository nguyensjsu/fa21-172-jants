# Starbucks Project

## Jay Solanki's Individual Status Report for Week 2

### My Accomplishments

* Created the HTML for password_changed and start_page.
* Connected these new HTML pages to the rest of the application and made changes to the CSS file to make these two new pages look good.
* Added the java code to provide functionality to the password reset page. This code changes the password of the user in the database.

### Challenges

* The java code added to the reset password page changes the entry in the users database table but when trying to log in using the new password, the authentication does not work.
