# Starbucks Project

## Tanav Kudupudi's Individual Status Report for Week 2

### My Accomplishments

* Added Auth0 to the back office
* Created HTML templates for the users, rewards, and orders page in back office
* Routed all the pages

### Challenges

* At times, there are whitelabels errors for the login and logout when using Auth0 because the port was 3030 in the original code, but we are using 8080.
